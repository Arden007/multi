    <h1>I am <strong>Arden Jacobs</strong>, a <strong>web developer student</strong></h1>
    <p>I am in the process of acquiring the necessary skills to be able to call myself a <strong>Developer</strong> that can 
        handle any task given to him. I'm a person who will go over and above to make sure that every project I recieve is a 
        success ,throught this attitude of mine I gained numerous skills throught self-learning to put my best work forward. 
        I am a person that believes when you do something "you do it to the best of your abilities ,and you do it correctly 
        the first time around so that you don't have to worry about fixing mistakes. Take pride in your work so you never 
        have to be ashamed for the work you put forward".
        <br> 
        <br>
        When I am not in front of a computer screen coding, I enjoy playing soccer, hikking, bonding with the people close to me,
        doing odd jobs around the house, gaming, watching anime etc.
